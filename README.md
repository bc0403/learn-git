Memo for learning git. Please read references from top to bottom.

## Github flow (online)
1. **create a new depository** with README.md and a license
2. **create a new branch** for new feature. 
3. coding on the new branch. If finished, **make a new pull request**, discussing...
4. **merge** the pull request to `master` branch, then delete the finished feature branch since it's code has been merged to the master (no useful anymore)

## Key points
1. Github's **pull requests workflow** is a popular way to create and review code.
2. **commit** messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you have done and why.
3. make a pull request on a `feature branch`, and the **team leader** review, discuss, and merge the pull request to `master` branch.
